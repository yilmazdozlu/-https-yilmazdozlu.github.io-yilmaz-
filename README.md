## Psycholinguistics
under the supervision of Masha Fedzechkina and Janet Nicol since December 2020. The benefits of hand gestures on second language vocabulary learning are investigated. I surveyed the literature on the effects of hand gestures on speech fluency, second language vocabulary learning, and memory. I learned experiment design, coding, statistical analysis, and R.
# Philosophy
## Parmenides
no supervision. I was fascinated in September 2020 when I read Plato's Parmenides. I studied Zeno's paradoxes in January 2021 and believed that Platonic answers to four of them are in Parmenides. My manuscript was rejected by Apeiron. In the summer, I prepared a preliminary work, "Parmenides: on the relationship between the One and Being." I surveyed the literature, sent my manuscripts to graduate students, professors, and journals for comments and objections, and I studied English writing to succeed. I sent my manuscript to Ancient Philosophy. It is under review.
## Philosophy
under the supervision of Jason Turner. I studied tense logic and the philosophy of time. I prepared drafts of my sample work "On the Incompleteness of Reality" every week since October, 2021.
