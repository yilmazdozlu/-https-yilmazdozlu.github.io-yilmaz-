# Effects of iconic gestures on second language vocabulary learning
Recent literature indicates that congurent iconic hand gestures aid memory in memorizing second language vocabulary. Under the supervision of Masha Fedzechkina and Janet Nicol and help of Hyeonah Kang, since December 2020, I investigate the potential benefits of hand gestures on memory. Our recent results show that iconic gestures are helpful in decoding meaning of foreign words when the information sources to decode the meaning is sparse. However, our results suggest that iconic gestures do not have a significant effect in memorizing second language vocabulary.
# Philosophy
## Parmenides
no supervision. I was fascinated in September 2020 when I read Plato's Parmenides. I studied Zeno's paradoxes in January 2021 and believed that Platonic answers to four of them are in Parmenides. My manuscript was rejected by Apeiron. In the summer, I prepared a preliminary work, "Parmenides: on the relationship between the One and Being." I surveyed the literature, sent my manuscripts to graduate students, professors, and journals for comments and objections, and I studied English writing to succeed. I sent my manuscript to Ancient Philosophy. It is under review.
# Reality
under the supervision of Jason Turner. I studied tense logic and the philosophy of time. I prepared drafts of my sample work "On the Incompleteness of Reality" every week since October, 2021.
